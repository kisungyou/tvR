\title{tvR : Total Variation Regularization}
\description{
\bold{tvR} provides tools for denoising noisy signal and images via
Total Variation Regularization. Reducing the total variation of the given signal is known to remove spurious detail while preserving
essential structural details. For now, we provide tools for \emph{denoising} only on 1-dimensional signals or 2-dimensional images,
where the latter be represented as 2d or 3d array.
